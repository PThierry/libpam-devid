  ~~~~~~~~~~~~ PAM DEVID SUBMODULE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PREAMBLE

The goal of this PAM module is to support dynamic device filtering
depending on a per-user centralized authorized device list.

When a user log in, this module get back the list of the authorized
devices (a serial id list) from LDAP, and inject this list in the
kernel in order to reduce authorized external devices to this list
only.
When the user log out, the device list is cleaned.

If two users are connected in the same time on the host, the device list
is the one of the last connected user. It is considered that only
one local user at a time is supported.

ACTIVATION

This module need to be added into pam session management for local authen-
tication client (like login).
It is done by adding the following line into the corresponding pam configu-
ration file (e.g. /etc/pam.d/login) :
----------8<----------
optional pam_devid.so
---------->8----------

Optional meens that if the module fails, the user is not disconnected from
the host. If the module fails, then no key is added.

MODULE OPTION

This module support the following command line option:
- debug: specify if the debug mode is activated or not. If not, only some
  basic information is written into auth.log.
- config: specify the config file full path. If not, default is /etc/pam_devid.conf

usage is then:
----------8<----------
optional pam_devid.so [debug] [config=<config_path>]
---------->8----------

MODULE CONFIGURATION

As explained before, this module support a configuration file, using a syntax
similar to usual ldap.conf files.
A sample configuration file is described in this package. Report to this file
in order to configure properly the module.

REQUIREMENTS

The detection of previous loggings in order to avoid LDAP requests when opening
a new term (for example) is based on the /var/run/utmp file. This means that
XDM (or GDM/KDM) must use this file to reccord a graphical session. Otherwise,
the module will not detect a previous authentication when opening the first
tty console, and will update the allowed devid a second time.
