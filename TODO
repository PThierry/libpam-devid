  ~~~~~~~~~~~~ PAM DEVID SUBMODULE TODO FILE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IMPORTANT

  Device ID values injection is not done ! PAM integration, LDAP requests
  and configuration management is finished but serial ids are not supported
  yet.

  The number of consecutive session opening for the same user is not supported
  yet. If a user is already logged, a new session of the same user should not
  modify the ACL configuration. In the same maner, when a user close one
  session when another session is still opened, the ACL should not be cleaned
  also.
